# Data checks

Written by `build_ab_package.py`; every number below is computed from `raw/`.

## San Juan weekly cases (CDC/PRDH, 1990/91-2012/13)

- **PASS**: 23 seasons x 52 weeks = 1196 rows; first week starts 30 Apr 1990, last week ends 29 Apr 2013.
- **PASS**: No duplicate weeks.
- **PASS**: No missing or negative counts.
- **PASS**: total_cases equals DENV-1 to -4 + untyped + estimated untested in every week.
- **PASS**: Week lengths: 1173 weeks of 7 days, 17 weeks of 8 days, 6 weeks of 9 days. Every long week ends on 31 Dec (weeks run from 1 Jan in 7-day steps), so fit on real dates, not week numbers.
- **PASS**: Weeks with untyped cases but no typed case, where the DENV-1 share is unknown and attribution gives 0: 96 of 1196 in the full series, 3 from 2008/09 on, 0 in 2010/11 and 2012/13. Before 2008 few positives were typed, so `denv1_attributed_cases` is only meaningful from 2008/09.
- **PASS**: Geography: San Juan-Carolina-Caguas Metropolitan Statistical Area (raw/cdc/san_juan_metadata.md).
- **PASS**: Case definition: laboratory-positive (serotype by RT-PCR, or IgM-positive), plus `additional_cases`, which CDC estimated for weeks when not all specimens were tested. Dated by week of symptom onset.

## Season 2010/2011

- **PASS**: 30 Apr 2010 to 29 Apr 2011, 52 weeks, 365 days.
- **PASS**: Totals: all lab-positive 4,696; typed DENV-1 2,594; DENV-1 attributed 3,863.9; estimated untested 22.
- **PASS**: Serotype mix of typed cases: DENV-1 82.2%, DENV-2 1.1%, DENV-3 0.0%, DENV-4 16.7%.
- **PASS**: Share of lab-positive cases with a serotype, weeks with 20+ cases: 0.55-0.94.
- **PASS**: Weeks with untyped cases but no typed case (DENV-1 share unknown, attributed as 0): 0.
- **PASS**: DENV-1-attributed peak: 228.6 in the week of 13 Aug 2010 (season week 16); weeks at half the peak or more: 15.

## Season 2012/2013

- **PASS**: 29 Apr 2012 to 29 Apr 2013, 52 weeks, 366 days.
- **PASS**: Totals: all lab-positive 5,283; typed DENV-1 2,692; DENV-1 attributed 4,091.2; estimated untested 38.
- **PASS**: Serotype mix of typed cases: DENV-1 77.5%, DENV-2 0.0%, DENV-3 0.0%, DENV-4 22.4%.
- **PASS**: Share of lab-positive cases with a serotype, weeks with 20+ cases: 0.52-0.92.
- **PASS**: Weeks with untyped cases but no typed case (DENV-1 share unknown, attributed as 0): 0.
- **PASS**: DENV-1-attributed peak: 185.8 in the week of 01 Jan 2013 (season week 36); weeks at half the peak or more: 18.

## DENV-1 history (used for the s0 evidence)

- **PASS**: Seasons with at most 1 typed DENV-1 case: 2000/2001, 2001/2002, 2002/2003, 2003/2004, 2004/2005, 2005/2006, 2006/2007.
- **PASS**: Typed DENV-1 cases before the calibration season: 2007/2008 125, 2008/2009 472, 2009/2010 1297; DENV-1 attributed over those three seasons: 2,892.

## Population

- **PASS**: N_h = 2,347,833 (San Juan metro, 2010, US Census estimate in the CDC repo) = 63% of Puerto Rico's 3.71 million (PAHO).
- **PASS**: d_h = 1 / (78.717 years x 365.25) = 3.4781e-05 per day (PAHO life expectancy, Puerto Rico 2010).
- **PASS**: Puerto Rico 2010 age structure (PAHO): 20.5% under 15, 34.9% under 25. Age-group totals sum to 3.76 million vs 3.71 million total (PAHO rounding).

## Parameter table

- **PASS**: R0 from the closed form with the baseline values: 1.03 at m = 2, and 2.27 at m = 9.75 (the value implied at s0 = 0.4).

## Temperature (NOAA GHCN-Daily, station RQW00011641, San Juan airport)

- **PASS**: 8,401 of 8,401 days present; days without a daily mean: 0.
- **PASS**: Mean daily temperature 30 Apr 1990-29 Apr 2013: 27.05 C, so mean extrinsic incubation 10.65 days and eps_v = 0.0939 per day (parameter table: 0.0935).
- **PASS**: 2010/11 weekly mean temperature 24.3-29.3 C, so extrinsic incubation 7.3-17.0 days.

## Puerto Rico weekly cases, OpenDengue V1.3 (island-wide)

- **PASS**: Epi year 2024: 52 weeks, 2023-12-31 to 2024-12-28, 6,088 cases.
- **NOTE**: Weeks of epi year 2024 labelled with another year in the source: 1 (filter by date or `epi_year`, not by the source's year label).
- **PASS**: Weekly 2024 total matches OpenDengue's annual 2024 figure (6,088).
- **PASS**: 2024 peak 217 in the week of 2024-09-29; weeks at half the peak or more: 30.
- **NOTE**: Weekly coverage 2013-12-29 to 2024-12-28; years with all-zero weeks (treat as missing, not as no dengue): 2017, 2018.
- **PASS**: Case definition 'Total' (suspected and confirmed as reported to PAHO), island-wide, no serotype, no municipality.
